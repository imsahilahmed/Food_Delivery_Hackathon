# Food Delivery Hackathon Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the Food Delivery Hackathon. 
It performs data merging, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to answer key business questions.

## Data
The analysis uses three datasets:
1. `orders.csv` – Transactional order data
2. `users.json` – User master data
3. `restaurants.sql` – Restaurant master data

The final merged dataset (`final_food_delivery_dataset.csv`) is used for all analysis.

## Analysis Performed
- Merging CSV, JSON, and SQL datasets into a single dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on:
  - Order trends over time
  - User behavior and membership impact
  - City-wise and cuisine-wise revenue
  - Restaurant ratings and performance
  - Revenue seasonality
- Feature engineering (e.g., quarters, rating ranges)

## Insights
- Top revenue-generating cities and cuisines
- High-value Gold vs Regular member analysis
- Restaurants with highest average order values
- Seasonal and quarterly revenue trends
